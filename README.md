# How to run?
**Before cloning this respository**, make sure you have clone the [simulator](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_simulator) respository and set up the packages properly. The setup instructions can be found [here](https://f1tenth.readthedocs.io/en/stable/going_forward/simulator/sim_install.html).

> After you have clone this respository, run the script:

`roslaunch chee0134_lab3 chee0134_roslab.launch`


## Videos
- As the size of the videos are too big, I have uploaded them into my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-3XLnYgGxhe20uPuyDwElxnCl_ZgSl7L?usp=sharing).


## Bugs
- The pid controller was working fine for a lot of attempts and for quite some time, but sometimes the vehicle starts wiggling although the parameters remain unchanged.
